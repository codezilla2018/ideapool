## Product ideas for CodeZilla 2018

- `IA0` : php business card generator library. Business card jpeg will be generated for given name, email, photo, web address(Add as QR code also).

- `IA1` : Firefox plugin to get quick information about stackoverflow account. Eg : notify reputation changes and important messages

- `IA2` : Email address extracting tool by keywords using java swing GUI. Search web pages using search engine API and capture emails.

- `IA4` : Nodejs twitter bot that tweets about latest movies with youtube trailer link. App will be deployed in heroku

- `IA5` : Firefox plugin that generates Harvard style reference for current URL and detect the reference type eg :- blog, website, book, journal etc..

- `IA6` : A simple grammar to convert raw(json/csv/tsv..etc) data into visual graphs(bar/line/pie charts ..etc).
eg :- "Draw Bar_graph for DataSource:AA with (X:time,Y:count) " will draw a bar graph for AA data source. you can use graph visualization js libraries like c3/d3 .. etc and conversion will be have this kind of flow. raw data (json/csv) + grammar ---> json object with suitable configurations ---> convert into graphs. Todo - design a suitable grammar, create a parser for that grammar and simple compiler to convert that strings into intermidiate json object. 

- `IA7` : A simple shareable Buisness card for your mobile phone(mobile app). Design a simple buisness card that can share with near by users through the wifi (something like shareIT app). It will allows to know about each others share your profile with others. It would be good to keep it as very similar to a buisness card but in a virtual space.
